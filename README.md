# Project1-Java061415
Your first week will be spent learning the basics of programming and version control, and setting up your GitHub account and professional profile. You are expected to have your GitHub account fully functional, and use your account to fork this repo. All answers should be pushed to a directory called `FirstnameLastname` in your version of this repository.

###The Basics of GitHub

First, make sure that you have set up your GitHub account as your professional portfolio. That means choosing a name and profile picture that you won't be ashamed to show future employers, and beginning to fill out extra profile information and social aspects of your GitHub profile. Start following the instructors (and the org Claim-Academy), and start forking some popular repos in Java!

Next, be sure that as the instructors take you through the first exercises and demos using Git, push all results and notes to a repository on GitHub called "GitExamples". 

Make sure that you have a handle on the following git commands:

+ init
+ clone
+ diff
+ remote
+ branch
+ checkout
+ merge
+ add
+ commit
+ push
+ pull
+ fetch
+ tag
+ reset

...and all of the command-line modifiers needed to make those commands work. It's tough to get at first, but worth it in the long run!

###Agile Workshops, Team Formation, and Code Presentations

We'll be having weekly presentations of your projects, and we'll present them in the style of "builds" to small groups of your peers (your teams) that you'll cling to for the rest of the course. For this week, the instructors will discuss what a future code review, build presentation, and Agile development environment might look like.
It's your job to do the following:

+ understand how sprints work
+ understand what needs to go into a presentation on a new build
+ understand how to prioritize new features
+ choose a team!
+ practice collaborating on a codebase with your team

###Daily Exercises

You will have daily exercises given to you by the instructors on data types, variables, and control flow statements. Push as much as you can up to GitHub as you learn them in a repository called `BasicExercises`.
